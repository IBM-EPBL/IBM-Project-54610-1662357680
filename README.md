 ## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
<div>
<p>This work mainly focuses on alerting the individuals arround baby so as to locate the baby in safer zone beforearrival of the parent. Among all the available wearable devices focusing on the conditions to provide thelocality, action and so forth of the child to the parents via wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi(wireless fidelity)becomes a very inconsistent resource to the communication. Hence by the implementation ofIOT technology it is planned to use SMS/MAIL as the method of communiquÃ© between the parent and childwearable device. 
  
    This project development uses the Arduino Uno microcontroller board based onATmega328P.The function of receiving SMS(message) or MAIL and calls are all due to the internet connectionto Arduino UNO by NODE Mcu. The supplementary modules are employed which will provide the presentsituation of the child via message/MAIL. 
  
    The external alert systems included here is to indicate the distresscondition is SOS Light indicator and Alarm Buzzer to produce sound, both are programmed in Arduino UNOboard</p> </div>
